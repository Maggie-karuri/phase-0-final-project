                        <p>The student grade calculator allows the user to input the grade the student scored and it outputs grade.</p>
                        <p>HTML, CSS, AND JavaScript were used in this project. To enhance functionality of the peoject, I used If---else statements which helps determine the grade associated with the score that the student input.</p>

                        <p>The speed calculator is used to assess whether the speed is past the allowed limit, and if the speed passes the limit, the driver receives semerit points. Also if they exceed certain points, their driving license is revoked.</p>
                        <p>In this project, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used to create the program. I used If---else statements to present the different scenarios.</p>
